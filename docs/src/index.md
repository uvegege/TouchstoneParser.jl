# TouchstoneParser

It implements the specification (versions **1.0, 1.1, 2.0 and 2.1**) and provides a simple API to access data and metadata.

## Notes

This package is currently **unregistered**. While the core functionality has been tested using examples from the official Touchstone specification, it has **not been extensively validated** against a wide variety of real-world files. Contributions or bug reports are welcome.

## Features

- [x] Parse Touchstone files in **v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, v2.1** (`read_touchstone`). 
- [x] Automatically detect format even if the filename does not contain the `.sNp` extension  
- [x] Write Touchstone files in the desired format (`write_touchstone`)  
- [x] Handle non-standard versions of the format (e.g., files generated by **HFSS**. Used **skrf** as reference because I didn't found other resources.)  
- [x] Support for comments.
- [x] Convenient access to data via `ts.data`, `ts.frequency`, `ts.noise_data`, `ts.noise_frequency`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Better validation to ensure Touchstone files strictly comply with the official specification.
- [ ] Enhanced customization options for writing files, including units, formatting, and ordering.
- [ ] Batch reading/writing for entire directories of Touchstone files.

## Installation

```julia
] add https://github.com/uvegege/TouchstoneParser.jl
```

## Usage

It's easy to write and read Touchstone files:

```julia
using TouchstoneParser

# Example 18
f = [2.0, 22.0]
S = [
    [[0.95 * cis(deg2rad(-26)), 3.57 * cis(deg2rad(157))];;
    [0.04 * cis(deg2rad(76 )), 0.66 *cis(deg2rad(-14))]], 
    [[0.60 * cis(deg2rad(-144 )), 1.30 * cis(deg2rad(40))];;
    [0.14 * cis(deg2rad(40)), 0.56 * cis(deg2rad(-85))]]
]

z0 = [50, 25.0]

noise_f = [4.0, 18.0]
noise_data = [NoiseData(0.7, 0.64 * cis(deg2rad(69)), 19), NoiseData(0.7, 0.46 * cis(deg2rad(-33)), 20)]

TouchstoneParser.write_touchstone("Example.s2p", f, S, z0; 
    version = "1.0", noise_data = noise_data, noise_f = noise_f, twoportorder = "21_12")

TouchstoneParser.write_touchstone("Example.ts", f, S, z0; 
    version = "2.1", noise_data = noise_data, noise_f = noise_f, twoportorder = "21_12")

ex_10 = read_touchstone("Example.s2p")
ex_21 = read_touchstone("Example.ts")

```

You can access the data like this:

```julia
ex_21.frequency        # Vector of frequencies [ts.units]
ex_21.data             # {ts.type} - parameters (Array{ComplexF64,3})
ex_21.noise_frequency  # Noise frequency points (if present)
ex_21.noise_data       # Noise data (if present)

ex_10.data == stack(S)
ex_21.data == stack(S)

ex_10.noise_data == noise_data
ex_21.noise_data == noise_data
```

## Metadata

It is possible to inspect the metadata of the read file with some key fields of the TSParser struct. 

For example, the `comments` field stores tuples containing the line where it was read and a string with the comment. This allows, for example, to extract the variables written in the touchstone by programs such as HFSS or CST using the `simvariables(ts)` function.
